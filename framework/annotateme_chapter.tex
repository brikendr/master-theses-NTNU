\chapter{AnnotateMe - An Entity Disambiguation Framework}
\label{chap:annotateme}
%Intro to the chapter
The work carried out by this research study can be logically divided into two parts that are closely interconnected with each-other. The first part represents the ground work on top of which we experiment with different data and methodologies in order to get answers to our first two research questions. Specifically, the first part represents the implementation of a named entity disambiguation (\ac{ned}) framework. Implementing the framework was crucial as it corresponds to the system which we try to gamify and transform into a \ac{gwap}. Having accurate representation of the identified named entities, their corresponding knowledge base candidates and the surrounding context compose the elements of the framework on which the success of the game design highly depends on. The first part of this research study is explained in great detail throughout this chapter by exploring previous related work specific to our problem, explaining the architecture of the framework, its underlying components, the methodology used to gather the data, prepare the experimental user study and analyze the results.
