Von Ahn in his pioneering work \cite{vonahn} focuses on one type of incentive to motivate players: enjoyment. He emphasized that the main mechanism to make players enjoy a GWAP is by providing them with a challenge. Usually in many gamified systems, challenges are achieved through mechanisms such as requiring a timed response, keeping scores which ensure competition among players, having players with similar level of skill compete against each other and so on. \cite{44} 

The design of Fastype strongly reinforces the competitive nature of players by providing challenges which allow players to compete with each other. During each game round, the system keeps track of the player's typing speed, and shows potential challenges based on their WPM (Words Per Minute) accordingly. To assure fair play, the system makes sure that the player is presented with challengers that have roughly the same level of skill. The challenge screen is presented to the player after she has completed the quiz. Figure \ref{fig:game-challenge-screen} shows the exact challenge screen which is used by players to send challenge requests to other players in the game. As seen in the figure, players can choose a number of points between 1 and 10 to challenge the other players. These points represent the reward or punishment mechanism of the challenge. To assure fair play of the game, players who are challenged will type the exact same words as the challengee, therefore an accurate measure of their skill is guaranteed. Finally, having a challenging game where each challenge matches the players skill level contributes to the feeling of enjoyment during gameplay \cite{43}.

An additional note that requires attention is the mechanism of punishment in a game. Schell \cite{51} (page 225) addresses the importance of punishment mechanisms in games and if balanced appropriately, they will give more meaning to everything in the game. Punishment mechanisms increase the value of certain game elements such as points. In Fastype, challenges and the betting mechanisms provide a way of punishment for players. In case of failure, their accumulated game points will be taken away, subsequently dragging the player down in lower levels in addition to increasing the failure percentage in their profile. Please note that the players have always the option of skipping challenges or bets on their answers. As a consequence of avoiding challenges and bets in the gameplay, the player will experience a slow progression and less dramatic gameplay as compared to other players who take risks by betting and challenging other players.
