The bonus questions represent the element of chance and surprise in our gameplay. The random nature of the bonus questions give the game a unique flavor of mystery and surprise since the player never knows what to expect from the bonus questions and therefore it encourages players to work on remembering what and how she was typing. Some bonus questions ask about the total number of words typed, the fastest word typed, the number of times a player failed to type a word correctly, the number of times a specific word occurred etc. The bonus question play an important role in the overall playfulness and feelings of enjoyment during gameplay.
