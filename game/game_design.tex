\section{Game Design}
\label{game:design}
Games With A Purpose (\ac{gwap}) are implemented in many fields and come in various forms. With regards to their overall game design, they tend to be graphically rich, provide simple interactions and give the player an experience of progression by scoring points, leveling players up and recognizing their effort. Additionally, the design of the game should reinforce quality measures and control the behaviour of players. Encouraging players to concentrate on the task and discourage them from malicious behaviour is crucial for quality control \cite{42}. The goal of our research study was to develop a \ac{gwap} that would serve as a tool for validating the named entity disambiguation task. The validating process should be performed at the highest quality level possible and still maintain player engagement by positively affecting their intrinsic motivation: experiencing feelings of competence, autonomy and relatedness while playing. The following subsection explore the different game elements and the corresponding game design principles used in Fastype that make this game enjoyable, fun to play and motivate players to come back and play. This results in generating large-scale annotation data for our named entity disambiguation task without players noticing what the underlying purpose of the game is.
