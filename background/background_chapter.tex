%What the chapter will say 
The findings acquired by this research study are based on theoretical models and principles of natural language processing, semantic web and game design. Having a clear understanding of the different components that compose the named entity disambiguation framework, conceptualizing the term "context" in relation to entity resolution and word sense disambiguation (\ac{wsd}) in general are the elements that this chapter will aim to clarify for the reader. Additionally, since the main contribution of this work is mainly focused on the gemification of non-game related tasks, and since the \ac{ned} framework provides the foundation on top of which game design principles will be applied, detailed insights on game design models and theories will be introduced in this chapter as well.

%Conclude chapter - what the chapter said, introduce the upcoming chapter
Understanding the theoretical foundations and ideas explained in this chapter is crucial to understanding and reasoning the contributions provided by this research study. In the next chapter, the implemented named entity disambiguation framework will be explored in great detail by first introducing the reader with state-of-the-art in the respective field and proceeding with technical and conceptual analysis of the different models and elements that build up the system.
