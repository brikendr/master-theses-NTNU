\section{Outline of Chapters}
In order to understand how named entity disambiguation is performed as well as understanding the underlying theoretical models and approaches used to build such framework, a theoretical background explaining notions and concepts with regards to \ac{ned}, context definition and gamification is necessary. Chapter 2 provides the theoretical background on which the work of this thesis is build upon. Chapter 3 goes into a detailed explanation of the named entity disambiguation framework excluding the GWAP which is discussed later on in Chapter 4. Both these chapters provide detailed elaboration on the methodology, related work, setting up and conducting experiments and also analysis on the results obtained. Discussions on the limitations, strengths, weaknesses and implications of this study are elaborated on Chapter 5 whereas in Chapter 6 we conclude our work and look upon potential future work to further advance the field.
